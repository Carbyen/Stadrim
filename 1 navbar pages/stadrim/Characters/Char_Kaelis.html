                Captain Victor Kaelis was once the epitome of a public hero, celebrated for his unwavering dedication to justice and his selfless acts of heroism. He rose to fame as the Mars' beloved protector, a symbol of hope and inspiration to all. But as time passed, the relentless weight of public scrutiny and ungratefulness took its toll on his once-idealistic spirit.
Throughout his career, Victor had saved countless lives, thwarted supervillains, and ensured the safety of his city. Yet, the more he gave, the more he felt that the public demanded of him. His heroic actions were often taken for granted, and the very people he had sworn to protect began to criticize and vilify him for decisions he made under immense pressure.
A pivotal moment came when Victor faced a catastrophic event that resulted in unavoidable collateral damage. The public turned against him, labeling him a menace and a danger to the city he had sworn to protect. Even though he had saved countless lives that day, the public focused on the destruction caused.
Broken and embittered, Victor decided to retire from his role as a hero. He withdrew from the public eye, disappearing from the city he had once defended so passionately. In his isolation, he found himself consumed by anger and disdain for the very people he had risked his life for.
Now, Captain Victor Kaelis harbors a deep-seated bitterness towards humanity. He views them as unkind, ungrateful, and hopelessly foolish. He despises the society that once hailed him as a hero and now dismisses him as a pariah.
In his solitude on Eris, Victor has become a recluse, living a life of cynicism and bitterness. He sees the world he once fought for as a place filled with hypocrisy and ignorance, and he no longer believes in the innate goodness of people. While he possesses incredible abilities and a deep sense of justice, he has turned his back on the world that once celebrated him, choosing instead to dwell in the shadows of his own disillusionment.
Now, he either strolls the dwarf planet's almost untouched surface or dwells on wether or not he should end all of humanity, battling against his past feelings of a greater good and morality.
